# Welcome to `meenpy`!

This library contains a few classes enabling succinct articulation and starage of equations, efficient assembly of systems of those equations, and powerful solving capabilities for those assembled systems. The current best examples of use are found in `test.py`, in particular `test_mized_system`.

## Installation and Usage Instructions

`meenpy` is not currently published, so you'll need to clone the library and manually pull any uppdates. As such, a prerequisite to this setup is [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git). After you have git, you can `clone` the repository to copy the source code.

`git clone https://github.com/calebmfowler/meenpy-dev.git`
